# Bragi-MPD
Full featured, mobile friendly MPD web client. Based on MPD.js

Bragi-MPD a fully featured, HTML5, mobile friendly MPD web client made using [MPD.js](https://github.com/bobboau/MPD.js). Bragi-MPD is intended to allow you to play your music the way you want, wherever you are, and with any device capable of loading a web page. You can manage playlists, search your music database, or manually navigate your music files. Inherently multi-user friendly it is like it's namesake, great at parties.

Bragi supports managing multiple outputs per MPD instance, and can be configured to manage multiple instances (on multiple hosts) making it ideally suited to controlling music on zoned sound systems.

Installation and Setup
---------------------

You must have a [working installation of MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/doc/user/) for many Linux distributions this is little more than 'apt-get install mpd'.

Once you have MPD working you will need to spin up an instance of [Websockify](https://github.com/kanaka/websockify). Once you have Websockify downloaded and you have navigated to it's directory and assuming you use the standard port for MPD, you can start up an instance of it that should allow you to get started with MPD.js with the following command:

    ./run 8800 localhost:6600

The version of all client side dependencies Bragi-MPD was built with are included in the repo. You simply have to clone the repo or download a zipped copy and extract into the webroot of a webserver. Apache or lighttpd would be good choices for this. If you don't feel like setting up a full webserver on Linux environments and just want to quickly test it out you can serve the files using this command from the root of the repo folder.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

After that you should be able to start playing your music by navigating to your server in a web browser.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is done in the config.js file. The default config file (default_config.js) has one instance on one host setup. If you wish to configure Bragi-MPD differently copy this file and rename it to just 'config.js' and it will override the default. The config file is basically a json object with a few sections.

The first section is defined by the key 'instances'. this is the list of MPD instances that Bragi-MPD knows about and can control. If only one client is set up (as it is in the default config) the instances tab will not be shown in the interface, otherwise you will be able to switch which instance you are controlling in the instance tab. You can have as many instances as you want. Each instance allows you to specify a name (only used in the UI), port number (default 8800), and host name (if not specified it will use the root of the host name you loaded the page from).

There is also a 'theme' section, here you can specify an array of additional css files to load. If the theme key is present it is expected to be an array full of strings which are URLs of css files (relative to the page's url). These additional files will be loaded following the normal files and will override them assuming they have equal or greater [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).
